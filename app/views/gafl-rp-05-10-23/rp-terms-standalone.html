      <p class="gov-body">A recurring card payment is a regular debit or credit card payment taken with your agreement to pay securely for future fishing licences.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Payments</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can give consent to set up a recurring card payment when buying a 12-month fishing licence online.</p> 
      <p>Our payment service provider (Worldpay) will take payments (in pounds) until you tell us or your bank to stop them. Payments will appear as 'Get a Fishing Licence' on your bank statement.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Payments will be taken annually before your new licence is issued.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The cost of a future 12-month fishing licence may change. For example, the cost may be higher because of a service-wide price increase, or lower if you become eligible for a senior licence.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If a recurring card payment fails, we will contact you so you can arrange to buy another licence if you want to continue to fish.</p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Payment reminders</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Before taking a recurring card payment, we will tell you the payment amount using the contact details you have provided.</p>
   
      <p class="govuk-body">If your contact details change, contact us to update your details by emailing <a href="mailto:enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk">enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk</a> or phoning 03708 506 506 (Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm). <a href="https://www.gov.uk/call-charges">Find out about call charges (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Cancelling a recurring card payment</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">You can cancel your recurring card payment to end the payment agreement at any time. Cancelling your recurring card payment will not cancel or refund your current licence â€“ you can still fish until your current licence expires.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you have received a refund for your licence (<a href="https://get-fishing-licence.service.gov.uk/guidance/refund-policy">see the refund policy</a>) your recurring card payment will be cancelled automatically.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"> If you would like to change the number of rods or type of fish covered by your next licence, you will need to cancel your recurring card payment and buy a new licence.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"> If you become eligible for a disabled concession, you can cancel your recurring card payment and buy your next licence at a reduced price.</p>
          <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Cancel online</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">You can cancel your recurring card payment online up to 11:59pm the day before your payment is due to be taken.</p>
          <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Cancel by phone or email</h3>
