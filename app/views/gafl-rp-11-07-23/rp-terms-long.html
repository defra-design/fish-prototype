       <p class="gov-body">To renew your licence automatically when it expires, you need to give consent to the following terms:</p>

       <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a payment of Â£33 will be taken now for a 12-month trout and coarse (2 rod) fishing licence</li>
        <li>when your licence expires, payments will be taken by your card provider every year to cover the cost of renewing your 12-month trout and coarse (2 rod) fishing licence
        <li>the payment amount taken may change - for example, if you become eligible for a discounted licence or if licence prices go up
        <li>we will send you an email reminder showing the payment amount before any future payments are taken</li>
        <li>future payments will be taken until [you tell us you want to cancel them?]
        <li>you can cancel an automatic payment at any time [how? by phoning? after receiving confirmation or reminder email? by finding this information on GOV.UK?</li>
